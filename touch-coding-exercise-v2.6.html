    <p>
        We'd like to get a feel for how you approach problems, how you think, and how you design your code.
        Please complete the exercise below using a language appropriate to the position (Java or Python), and send us your working and tested solution.

        Please do not share the test on social media (GitHub, Twitter etc).
        Thank you and have fun!
    <p>

            Consider the following credit card fraud detection algorithm:

            <ul>
                <li>A credit card transaction is comprised of the following elements;</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>hashed credit card number</li>
                    <li>timestamp - of format 'year-month-dayThour:minute:second'</li>
                    <li>price - of format 'dollars.cents'</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Transactions are to be received as a comma separated string of elements eg. '10d7ce2f43e35fa57d1bbf8b1e2, 2014-04-29T13:15:54, 10.00'</li>

                <li>A credit card will be identified as fraudulent if the sum of prices for a unique hashed credit card number, for a given day, exceeds the price threshold T.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Write a method on a class, which, when given a list transactions, a date and a price threshold T, returns a list of hashed credit card numbers that have been identified as fraudulent for that
        day. Feel free to create any additional classes you need to support the design of your solution.
    </p>

    <p>
        We expect to see tests that prove your code works.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are looking for pragmatic, testable and maintainable code. If in doubt, refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> principle. Good luck!
